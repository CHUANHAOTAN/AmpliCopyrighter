The scripts and data in this folder are useful for producing a file suitable
for Copyrighter input

Overview:

1/ Download IMG data from ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/IMG/img_core_v400.tar

2/ Get IMG metadata:
Go to IMG > Genome Browser: http://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/w/main.cgi?section=TaxonList&page=taxonListAlpha
In the Table Configuration section:
* Genome Field     > Click All
* Project Metadata > Click All
* Data Statistics  > Click All
Click Display Genomes Again
In the Genome Browser section > Click Select All
Finally, click the Export button
Fix mistakes in the metadata:
  - Two occurences of "\r" (^M) are to be replaced by ""
  - taxonoid 2515154013 has two extra fields: remove the two cells containing
      "Human wound, cranian"
  - Replace cells containing "-1" by ""

3/ Fix missing IMG species names in the metadata file using the script fix_img_taxonomy

4/ Identify and extract 16S/18S sequences from IMG genomes using different methods:
relying on IMG, searching with RNAmmer or INFERNAL. Use the script extract_ssu_seqs
for this.

5/ Download rrNDB database

6/ Correct 16S/18S copy number by comparing IMG number to RNAmmer, INFERNAL and
rrNDB, using the script fix_img_copy_number.

7/ Re-run step 6, but detecing species average outliers this time (option -a 1)

8/ Using the updated SSU sequence obtained at the previous step, run the script
img_gg_matcher to associate IMG IDs to GreenGenes IDs (at strain level).

9/ Use the script data_combiner to merge traits from sources like IMG, Greengenes
and GOLD into a single file.

10/ Use script use_cluster_repr to replace Greengenes IDs by Greengenes IDs
clustered at 99%

11/ Optional: Use the script trait_by_clade to average duplicate trait values
per genome if needed. This will also issue warnings for inconsistent 16S counts.

12/ Use the script estimate_species_trait to estimate the 16S copy number for all
species un the Greengenes taxonomy using the phylogenetic independent contrasts 
method. Alternatively, you may want to estimate this same information at higher
levels of the taxonomy using trait_by_clade_pic, trait_by_clade_weighted or
trait_by_clade. 

13/ Use the resulting file in copyrighter.

14/ Optional: use the script draw_trait_dist to produce a plot of the SSU gene
number across the Greengenes taxonomy
