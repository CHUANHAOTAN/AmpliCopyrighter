The scripts and data in this folder are useful for producing a file suitable
for Copyrighter input

Overview:
1/ Use the script extract_img_16S to get the 16S sequences from IMG genomes.
2/ Use the script img_gg_matcher to associate more IMG IDs GG (prokMSA) IDs.
3/ Use the script data_combiner to merge traits from sources like IMG,
Greengenes and GOLD into a single file.
4/ Optional: Use the script trait_by_genome to average duplicate trait values
per genome. This will issue warnings if for inconsistent 16S counts.
5/ Use the script trait_by_clade_weigthed (or trait_by_clade) to summarize the
trait at different taxonomic levels.
6/ Use the resulting file in copyrighter.
