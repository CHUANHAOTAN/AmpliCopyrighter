INSTALLATION


Dependencies
  You need to install these dependencies first:

  *   Perl (>= 5.10.0)
      <http://www.perl.com/download.csp>

  *   make
      Many systems have make installed by default. If your system does
      not, you should install the implementation of make of your choice,
      e.g. GNU make: <http://www.gnu.org/s/make/>

  The following CPAN Perl modules are dependencies that will be installed
  automatically for you:

  *   Bio::Community

  *   Getopt::Euclid (>= 0.4.3)

  *   Method::Signatures

      First released with Perl v5.7.3

  *   Scalar::Util

If you want to use the utilities included in the ./preprocessing/ folder, you
will need to install additional CPAN dependencies. See the Makefile.PL file
for details.


Procedure
  To install CopyRighter globally on your system, run the following commands
  in a terminal or command prompt:

  On Linux, Unix, MacOS:

     perl Makefile.PL
     make

  And finally, with administrator privileges:

     make install

  On Windows, run the same commands but with nmake or dmake instead of make.


No administrator privileges?
  If you do not have administrator privileges, CopyRighter needs to be
  installed in your home directory.

  First, follow the instructions to install local::lib at
  <http://search.cpan.org/~apeiron/local-lib-1.008004/lib/local/lib.pm#The
  _bootstrapping_technique>. After local::lib is installed, every Perl
  module that you install manually or through the CPAN command-line
  application will be installed in your home directory.

  Then, install CopyRighter by following the instructions detailed in the
  "Procedure" section above.
