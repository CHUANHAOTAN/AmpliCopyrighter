This is an XML wrapper that provides a GUI for CopyRgihter in Galaxy (http://galaxy.psu.edu/).

Place these files in your Galaxy directory. More information at http://wiki.g2.bx.psu.edu/FrontPage.

Note: You can define a default CopyRighter trait database in Galaxy by defining a builtin dataset in the 'trait_db' data table.
